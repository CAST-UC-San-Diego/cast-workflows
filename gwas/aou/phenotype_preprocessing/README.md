# Phenotype preprocessing for AoU

Usage example:

```
./aou_phenotype_preprocessing.py --phenotype ALT
```

Notes:
* get trait-specific covars (LDL)
* Take in list of blessed samples from Tara's script
* Need to hard-code concept IDs of other phenotypes
* Run on all phenotypes and store in shared bucket
