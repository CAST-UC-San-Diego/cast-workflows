# Phenotype preprocessing for AoU

Notes:
* Need person/measurement queries per trait. Store in one python or SQL file?
* make this as a python script for each pt
* Combine demog/measurement
* Drop NAs, check units
* drop outliers
* median of medians
* get trait-specific covars


TDL:
* Can we reuse code for the queries by just replacing the concept IDs for each one?
* Take in list of blessed samples from Tara's script
