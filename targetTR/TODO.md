# Wishlist and TDL

* Update docker organization to have subdirectories with tool versions e.g. trtools/trtools-5.0.1/Dockerfile etc.
* Add timing/cost and description of where to find outputs to UKB
* set memory for tasks from command line option (and unused remove minMemory option)
* rename targetTR to hipstr since it can actually be used to perform non-targeted analysis
* consider ability to pass custom dumpstr/hiptr flags through command line options to launcher scripts
